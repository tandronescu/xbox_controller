# xbox_controller

The work I did on the 2018 Mars Rover for the University of Waterloo Robotics Student Design Team. I created a ROS package which allowed the Rover to move using an xbox controller. Furthermore, there is also functionality to toggle between different modes so the Rover could easily switch modes when necessary.
